## Introduction
....

## Data
You can download ISIC data executing **download_isic_data.sh** (found in utilities folder). iToBoS data is not yet public although will be publicly released in the future.

To execute the script just open a terminal and execute:

```
./download_isic_data.sh data_folder_path
```

You must have given execution permissions to the script via:

```
chmod +x download_isic_data.sh
```

The script will download and unzip resized 2020 and 2019 data (including 2017 and 2018) of all available sizes by Chris Deotte.

## Software

### Software used during the project:
-  Python: 3.10.12
-  Nvidia Drivers: 525.147.05
-  CUDA: 11.5.119
-  cuDNN: 8.9.2

The training of the models was done using a **Nvidia A100 80G**, GPU is highly recommended to execute this project in order to have acceptable training times.

## Installation
You can install all necessary requeriments and dependencies by using:

```
pip install -r requreriments.txt
```

## Usage
Training commands of the best models. Training time for the models ranges from x to y hours.

After training, models will be saved in `./weights/` and training logs will be saved in `./logs`
```
python train.py ....
```

You can make predictions on a test set. In case you test with ISIC 2020 test data a submission in order to check test accuracy will be saved in `./submissions/`
```
python predict.py ....
```
